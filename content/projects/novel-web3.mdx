## Project Overview
**Nov3l** is a personal full-stack web3 project that functions as a decentralized fiction library. It allows users to connect via their browser's wallet extension, such as Metamask, and engage with the platform by uploading and funding fiction using Ethereum.

### Key Features
- **User Interaction:** Users connect with their web3 wallets to interact with the platform.
- **Upload & Fund Fiction:** Users can upload their fiction works and fund others' works using Ethereum.
- **Storage:** Fiction content is stored on the Filecoin blockchain using the IPFS protocol.
- **NFT Minting:** The Nov3l smart contract mints an NFT to the user's connected wallet address, proving ownership of the uploaded work. The NFT metadata is also stored on IPFS.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Vite/React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Smart Contracts:** Thirdweb for writing and deploying
- **Deployment:** AWS instance running NGINX
