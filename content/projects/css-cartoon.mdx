## Project Overview
**Vanilla CSS Cartoon** is an experiment built whilst I was first learning CSS and Javascript. On mobile and portrait screens, where the view isn't fixed to the center of the room but pans from left to right instead, I put in some perspective shifts and layout changes. I've written a blog post on some of the more challenging <a href="../blog/css_illustrations" target="_blank" className="text-[green] dark:text-[lightgreen]">CSS Illustrations</a>.

### Key Features
- **Responsive Perspective Shifts:** In portrait, when the narrow view moves from left to right, there are perspective shifts.
- **Vanilla CSS Only:** All shapes and images were achieved using only vanilla CSS with the purpose of the challenge and learning.
- **Javascript Interactivity:** As I was also beginning to learn Javascript at the time, I added interactivity to the animation.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance running Apache (LAMPP)
