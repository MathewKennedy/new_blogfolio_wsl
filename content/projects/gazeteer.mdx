## Project Overview
**Gazetteer** is a <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank" className="text-[green] dark:text-[lightgreen]">Leaflet JS</a> maps application built as part of a full-stack web development course. It uses multiple geodata APIs to display a range of information for a selected country. In my early learning it was a vital step in my comfort with APIs, libraries, documentation, and responsive design. It was also a lesson in gracefully handling situtuations where APIs are discontinued, as happened during development with the Triposo API that powered the hidden gems feature.

### Key Features
- **Geodata:** The app displays the area, population, capital, exchange rate, geolocated Wikipedia articles, weather station data, headlines, and national holidays for the selected country.
- **Planner** Previously used the Triposo API (discontinued) to show hidden gems for a selected country and to automatically plan a trip for you.
- **ISS**: Tracks the International Space Station and shows its readings. 
- **Night Mode**: The theme toggle switches the tile layer used in Leaflet JS for night mode.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Leaflet JS
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance running Apache (LAMPP)
