## Project Overview
**TAB** is a bridging and commercial mortgage company. I was one of five developers in our small, amazing tech team. I worked mostly on the financial dashboards, which provided automated statements, AI document summary, data visualisation, and user account management. I joined as TAB was transitioning into a CI/CD pipeline, and converting code into scalable modules with a view to offering the specialised application as Software as a Service, so it was an incredible time to learn. I also worked on the TAB website, which included an exchange for fractional ownership of loans and properties. Since leaving due to a change in location, I continue to do contract work for TAB.

### Key Features
- **AI Chatbots:** I helped to integrate custom AI chatbots.
- **Bulk Updates:** I built a feature that that allowed staff to safely bulk update records with identifiers of their choice and using mutliple document formats.
- **Notifications:** I built an application-wide notification system to notify staff of updates.
- **Statements:** I modernised the design of statement PDFs and developed automated statement jobs that prevented staff waiting for them to load to continue working.
- **URL Shortener:** I built an in-house URL shortener.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** PHP Laravel, Bootstrap, jQuery, Metronic 8
- **Backend:** PHP Laravel, SQL, Node, AWS, Docker
- **APIs:** OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, 
- **Deployment:** AWS instance running NGINX
