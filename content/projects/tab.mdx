## Project Overview
**TAB** is a bridging and commercial mortgage company. On the small team of five developers, I worked on the TAB website, which included an exchange for fractional ownership, and the backend dashboards, which provided automated statements, AI document summary, data displays, and user account management. After leaving due to a change in location, I continued to do contract work for TAB.

### Key Features
- **AI Chatbots:** Users of the website could use AI chatbots for enquiries.
- **AI Document Summary:** Management, finance, and underwriting could summarise documents using AI.
- **Bulk Updates:** I personally built a feature that allowed staff to bulk update records in mutliple ways.
- **Notifications:** I personally built a notification system to notify staff of updates.
- **Statements:** I personally developed automated statement jobs that sped up the process and prevented staff waiting for them to load.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** PHP Laravel, bootstrap, jQuery
- **Backend:** SQL, Node, AWS, Docker
- **Deployment:** AWS instance running NGINX
