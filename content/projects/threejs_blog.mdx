## Project Overview
**Three JS Blog** is a blog for my Three.js learning. It prompted me to learn about the WebGL beneath three.js, and the OpenGL beneath WebGL. I've since played with OpenGL on Windows using the GLFW library.

### Key Features
- **Interactive 3D Models** The user can interact with the 3D models both with touch on the three.js scene canvas, and with a range of React component inputs, depending on the model.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, JSX, CSS, Three.js, Tween.js
- **Modelling:** Cinema 4D
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance running NGINX
