## Project Overview
**Luisa Brito's Portfolio** is a full-stack NextJS design portfolio. Luisa is Global Brand and Creative Strategy Design Manager at BCG. This portfolio is scalable and modular, and allows Luisa to add new projects easily, specifying custom grids of images and videos. The website was built according to the Figma designs as below, with a focus on simplicity, accessibility, and core web vital metrics - A lot of large, high quality media was involved, which was optimised to speed up the largest contentful paint, reduce the first input delay, and avoid cumulative layout shift. 

### Key Features
- **Auth:** A password from Luisa's CV (or my own CV) is required to view the portfolio, as it includes corporate projects.
- **Client Updatability:** Luisa can upload new projects and blogs, specifying custom grids and line breaks without further development.
- **Image Optimisation:** I optimised large, high quality images without visible loss, converting them to webp and using Next's image component for blur data.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** NextJS/React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** NextJS 14 Pages API
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance running NGINX
