## Project Overview
**DEVoid** is a live demo of a full-stack React social media platform. I'm building it to learn more about social media architecture. I'm using Material UI and Tailwind to create reusable modular widgets. It's a passion project that took a back seat during full-time development employment. I'm still working on more features for the love of it when I can. It was the first project in which I fully explored MongoDB and document databases in a larger project.

### Key Features
- **User Interaction:** Currently, users can sign up, post and upload images, like posts, add / remove friends, and test without an account.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Material UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** MongoDB, AWS
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance running NGINX
