## Project Overview
**DEVoid** is a live demo of a full-stack React social media platform. I'm building it to learn more about the architecture of social media websites, friend connections, posts, timelines, and likes. I'm using Material UI and Tailwind to create reusable modular widgets. It's a passion project that took a back seat during full-time development employment. I'm still working on more features for the love of it when I can. It was the first project in which I fully explored MongoDB and document databases in a larger project.

### Key Features
- **Signup:** Users can sign up, or "try without an account".
- **Post:** Users can post text and images to their timeline.
- **Friends:** Users can add and remove friends, and see a timeline of friend's posts.
- **Likes:** Users can like and unlike posts.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Material UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** MongoDB, AWS
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance running NGINX
