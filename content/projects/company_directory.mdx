## Project Overview
**Company Directory** is a single page application built as part of a full-stack web development course. It uses functional PHP scripts to perform SQL CRUD, Javascript for SPA behaviour, and bootstrap for styling. In my early learning it was a fantastic way to learn the LAMPP stack, SSH and the linux CLI, functional PHP, Javascript DOM manipulation for SPA filtering and searching, safe SQL, and responsive design.

### Key Features
- **Contacts:** Allows create, read, update, and delete of employees, departments, and locations.
- **Search and Filter**: SPA searching and filtering.
- **Dependent Records**: Records cannot be deleted if they have dependent records.
- **Escaping**: Escaped to avoid SQL injection.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap 5
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance running Apache (LAMPP)
