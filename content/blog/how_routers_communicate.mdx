- Antennas (transmitters and receivers) with gif of oscillating dipole
- Modulation - mention AM (amplitude modulation) and FM (frequency modulation in radio), and modems (modulate-demodulate) built into routers now
- Mention frequency, 2.4ghz and 5ghz (billion waves per second), creating different bands to separate traffic
- Once data has reached router PCB, talk about the tables used in a router and why, with some code block examples and commands
- Cool images and Wifi visualised with credits
