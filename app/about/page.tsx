                    I'm a passionate full-stack software engineer. I acquired a National Diploma in Computer Science at college, and found my passion developing my own applications and games.<br/><br/>
                    Since graduating from a full-stack engineering traineeship, I've been working full-time on financial applications at TAB, a bridging and property finance specialist.<br/><br/>
                    I'm continually expanding my knowledge through self-study in computer science, mathematics, and physics, applying these learnings to enhance my problem-solving and development abilities.

                I'm really proud that our small team of five developers at TAB was shortlisted for the "Scaling at Pace" award in the 2023 UK PropTech Awards.
                Shortly after, we were also finalists for "The Best Proptech Company" at the Property Reporter Awards 2024! üèÜ
